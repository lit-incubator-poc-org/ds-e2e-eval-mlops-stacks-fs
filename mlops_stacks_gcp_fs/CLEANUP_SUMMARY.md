# MLOps Stack C## ✅ What Remains (Essential Components)

### **Reorganized Structure**

#### **New `/serving/` Directory**
All model serving components are now organized in a dedicated directory:

```
serving/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── OnlineTableDeployment.py     # Complete online table and serving deployment
│   └── ValidationNotebook.py        # Comprehensive deployment validation  
├── config/
│   ├── serving_endpoint_config.json # Active serving endpoint configuration
│   ├── test_single_prediction.json  # Single prediction test input
│   ├── test_batch_predictions.json  # Batch prediction test inputs
│   └── [legacy configs...]          # Old configurations for reference
├── setup_serving.py                 # Serving utilities  
├── test_online_tables.py           # Testing utilities
├── create_serving_model.py         # Model creation utilities
└── README.md                        # Serving-specific documentation
```

#### **Essential Notebooks** 
✅ **`serving/notebooks/OnlineTableDeployment.py`** - **Primary deployment notebook**
- Creates Unity Catalog online tables from feature tables
- Deploys model serving endpoint with automatic feature enrichment  
- Configures monitoring and auto-capture
- **This is your main serving deployment tool**

✅ **`serving/notebooks/ValidationNotebook.py`** - **Deployment validation**
- Online feature store health checks
- Model serving endpoint validation
- End-to-end prediction pipeline testing
- Performance and monitoring validation
- **Run this after deployment to verify everything works**

✅ **`deployment/model_deployment/notebooks/ModelDeployment.py`** - **Legacy deployment**
- Traditional model deployment without online features
- Part of existing MLOps workflow jobs
- Kept for backward compatibility What Was Cleaned Up

### **Notebooks Removed**
The following notebooks were removed from `/deployment/model_deployment/notebooks/` as they were redundant or debugging-specific:

- ❌ `CheckRuntimeVersion.py` - Runtime validation (functionality moved to ValidationNotebook.py)
- ❌ `DebugAzureOnlineStoreFix.py` - Azure-specific debugging (integrated into OnlineTableDeployment.py)  
- ❌ `DiagnoseModelFeatureBinding.py` - Feature binding diagnostics (functionality moved to ValidationNotebook.py)
- ❌ `QuickServingTest.py` - Basic serving test (comprehensive testing in ValidationNotebook.py)
- ❌ `SetupModelServing.py` - Model serving setup (integrated into OnlineTableDeployment.py)
- ❌ `TaxiFarePredictionService.py` - Prediction service code (functionality covered by serving endpoint)
- ❌ `TestModelFeatureIntegration.py` - Feature integration test (replaced with ValidationNotebook.py)

## 📋 What Remains (Essential Components)

### **Essential Notebooks (3 Total)**
✅ **`OnlineTableDeployment.py`** - Complete online table setup and model serving deployment
- Creates Unity Catalog online tables from feature tables
- Deploys model serving endpoint with automatic feature enrichment
- Configures monitoring and auto-capture
- **This is your primary deployment notebook**

✅ **`ModelDeployment.py`** - Standard model deployment (legacy/fallback)
- Traditional model deployment without online features
- Used as backup if online table deployment fails
- Part of existing MLOps workflow jobs

✅ **`ValidationNotebook.py`** - Comprehensive deployment validation
- Online feature store health checks
- Model serving endpoint validation
- End-to-end prediction pipeline testing
- Performance and monitoring validation
- **Run this after deployment to verify everything works**

### **Essential Jobs (All Kept)**
✅ **`feature-engineering-workflow-asset.yml`** - Creates and updates feature store tables
✅ **`model-workflow-asset.yml`** - Trains model with feature store integration  
✅ **`batch-inference-workflow-asset.yml`** - Batch predictions for large datasets
✅ **`monitoring-workflow-asset.yml`** - Model performance monitoring (future use)
✅ **`ml-artifacts-asset.yml`** - MLflow model registry configuration

## 🎯 Streamlined Deployment Process

### **New Simplified Workflow**
1. **Infrastructure**: `databricks bundle deploy`
2. **Feature Engineering**: `databricks bundle run write_feature_table_job`  
3. **Model Training**: `databricks bundle run model_training_job`
4. **Online Deployment**: Run `serving/notebooks/OnlineTableDeployment.py` notebook
5. **Validation**: Run `serving/notebooks/ValidationNotebook.py` notebook

### **Key Benefits of Reorganization**
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: 3 focused notebooks vs 9 mixed-purpose files
- ✅ **Clear Organization**: Dedicated `/serving/` directory for all serving components
- ✅ **Separated Concerns**: Training, deployment, and serving are clearly separated
- ✅ **Better Documentation**: README updated with detailed training and serving instructions
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: All config files organized and documented
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Logical structure makes debugging and updates simpler
- ✅ **Preserved Functionality**: All essential capabilities retained and enhanced

## 📖 Updated Documentation

The README.md has been updated with:
- 🚀 **Quick Start Guide** - 3-step deployment process
- 📋 **Available Workflows** - Clear job and notebook descriptions
